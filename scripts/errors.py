File Description:
The errors file is used to calculate the various types of errors that are used
in this dataset. Localization Error is the euclidean distance between each
latitude and longitude measurement for the prediction and truth. The Number of
Misclassified is the number of missclassified samples. Standard Error is the
error defined by the creators of the dataset for the IPIN2015 competition. In
this competition building missclassifications were penalized by 50 meters each 
and floor missclassifications were penatlized by 4 meters each. The Standard
Error is given by the pentalties multiplied by the number of missclassifcations
plus the Localization Error. Finally there is a coordinate probability error
that calculated the probability of being under 10 meters.
The main function here is compute_errors while
everything else is a helper function.

    Computes the Localization Error by computing the euclidean distance between
    the predicted latitude and longitude and the true latitude and longitude.
    
    Parameters: prediction : (Dataframe)

    Computes the number of missclassifications by summing how many elements
